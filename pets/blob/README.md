blob blob blob blob... how far **down** can we go? 

Just kidding! 


A game where you can control a blob and squish it in any direction (it's actually only 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees)

### Controls:
Left Arrow - Toggle Glitter!!âœ¨
Right Arrow - Change Blob OrientationðŸ”„
Left Arrow - Toggle Glitter!!âœ¨
Right Arrow - Change Blod OrientationðŸ”„
Down Arrow - SQUISH THE BLOB!!!!
Down Arrow - SQUISH THE BLOB!!!!

There's also a hidden code... it's a variation of the Konami code due to the 3-key limitation... hidden somewhere in this README!!ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­

btw it turns your blob into a COOKIE and it get's EATENâ€”NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
