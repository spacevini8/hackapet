# Your Pocket Arctic Fox!
It's a small fox tamagotchi-clone!
*Submitted for Hack Club's Hackapet YSWS*

128x128 screen, ESP32-S2FH4



**A very simple dynamic: Keep your fox happy and full for it to be healthy (and alive)!**

- Type S for launching a stick for it to play!
- Type R for feeding it a rabbit leg to regenerate its hunger!

(Sprites drawn by me :3)

## THANKS AND GETTING STARTED
Work in progress (maybe, if people like this enough I might add more features and polish it more.) **Suggestions and feedback
are always happily accepted!**
