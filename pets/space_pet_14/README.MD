# Space Pet 14

This is a game inspired by the games [Space Station 13/14](https://spacestation14.com/)

Your are a [moth person](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Playable_Species#Moths) (yes, you read that right) by the name "Erebus Nightflitter", you're on a [space station](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Maps) and you're working as an engineer, your job is to keep the station running, earn points and don't screw anything up!

# Your Job

You have to do a couple things to keep the station afloat

- Keep the [tiders](https://www.reddit.com/r/ss14/comments/1d5d6pr/how_to_tide_101_starter_tide/) out! Doors might start [opening](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Hacking), you have to fix them when they do!
- Keep the [AME](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Power#The_Antimatter_Engine) running! make sure it's fueled up and no pesky [antags](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Antagonist#Syndicate_agent) mess with it!
- Keep [solars](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Power#Solar_Power) in check!
- Keep the [singulo](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Power#Gravitational_Singularity_Engine) from loosing!
- Keep the [TEG](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Power#The_Thermoelectric_Generator_(TEG)) running, though even I have no idea how to do that!
- Get screamed at by the crew! It's part of the job!

# How do you play?

You might have noticed that you can not go down, only up, left and right, well, when you reach the top, you automatically loop to the bottom, each time this happens, you progress the game, each time you proverbialy "pass go" (going to a new "round") there will appear a random warning, maybe some tider opened the doors, maybe someone cut the singulo wire, maybe the TEG is acting up, you will have to fix these as fast as possible or risk losing points! you will also have to eat, each round your hunger goes up and you have to eat, being the funny moth person that you are, you eat cloth, each time you iteract with the food dispenser it will cost you 10 score, run out of score, and the game is over! Oh and please, don't foget to have fun, in [spess](https://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/ecw3se/spessman_alignment_chart/)!

## WIP

The game **_isn't finished yet_** and probably won't be completed by the deadline but I'll keep updating it even after the deadline!

## Use of AI

**SOME** AI **WAS** used in the making of this game, I mostly used it to debug and do some things I didn't know how to do, at least 85%-90% of the code is mine/copied **NOT** AI generated, ***I AM NOT A "VIBE CODER"***
