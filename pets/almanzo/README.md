When you reach a 100 points, it's kinda like the next level and you go deeper into the ocean. You have to reach 300 points

NOTE - This is a simple game that I have made. I have never done pixel art, nor made a game in python. Overall, I am pretty proud of myself. It doesn't look very pretty, nor any good, however the experience has taught me . I honestly have to thank my friends for being motivational supporters, because honestly I have really bad commitment issues. 

I hope to make the game even better. This is my messy first make of a game, but it could be something better.


After recieveing the hardware, I want to create a 3D printed shell case.
